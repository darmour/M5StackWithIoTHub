When creating this function, I used this step by step guide: https://www.10thmagnitude.com/step-step-guide-creating-functions-within-azures-iot-hub/

If you follow this guide, then the only file you will need to use is the <a href='https://github.com/darmour/M5StackWithIoTHub/blob/master/AzureFunction/ForwardColor/run.csx'>run.csx</a>
